  <h2> Beck A</h2>

<p> My roots are in California and my family originates within the Pueblo Nation borders in New Mexico. During the mid 1800's my maternal grandfather's great grandparents immigrated from Basque country where their migration trail was through the northern Atlantic, crossing the Canadian border and down the middle of the country. My maternal grandmother was raised in Santa Fe and Alberquerque, New Mexico just outside the Tiwa Reservation (this would be her tribe).  Recently during a visit with the elders and at their table, they told me that they were not allowed to say they were indigenous because the white people were abducting or disappering first nation people.  Today doesnt seem much different.   </p>

  <h2> Education Goals
</h2>

 
<br>    
        <p>
            I'd like to get an MS in Cyber Security.
        Before the MS, I'm interested in learning as much web development as possible.  
    Acquire a few more certs such as the CCNA, CISSA, SEC. Once I've completed my tech schooling, I will refocus on woodworking education. There's so much to learn as technology continues to integrate with woodworking such as CNC.  My ultimate goal will be to create a community workshop.
