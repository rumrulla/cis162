      <p> I am pursuing an Information Technololgy degree in cybersecurity.  
       I have family throughout California and New Mexico.  
       I enjoy cooking in my off days and if I have energy, I like to bike on a roadbike and drive to scenic parks.  
       My favorite topics right now are most things security, cybersecurity solutions to ongoing online crime, and clothing designs. </p>
