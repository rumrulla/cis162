  <h2> Woodworking Goals</h2>

<p> After I graduate, I'll want to focus more on woodworking and eventually build a workshop that will service the community.  </p>

  <h2> Resources
</h2>

 
<br>    
        <p>The better choice for seeking out grants and loans to establish a workshop is to think local. But before I try to become a nonprofit or work under a nonprofit, I will seek revenue through video recording woodworking as I build kitchen cabinets, or maybe a little woodturning.  Wood projects that are published on social media tend to recieve a decent amount of viewership as long as it easy to watch.
